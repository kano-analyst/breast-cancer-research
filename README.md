# Interpretable Machine Learning Approach for Breast Cancer Classification

Welcome to the official repository for the research paper *"Interpretable Machine Learning Approach for Breast Cancer Classification"* by Ahmad Tijjani Garba and Hafsah Shuaibu Hamza, submitted to the *Human Centric Intelligent Systems Journal* (Springer). This project explores the use of interpretable machine learning models for breast cancer classification, with a focus on Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and CatBoost, enhanced by Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME).

## Project Overview

Breast cancer remains a critical global health challenge, necessitating reliable and interpretable diagnostic tools. This study evaluates multiple machine learning models on two datasets—Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBDC) and Coimbra Breast Cancer Dataset—to classify breast cancer cases. Key performance metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score) are analyzed, and LIME is employed to provide interpretability, addressing the "black-box" problem in AI-based medical diagnostics. Logistic Regression emerged as the top performer, achieving accuracies of 0.97 (WBDC) and 0.84 (Coimbra).
